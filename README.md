# What is runaOS Loopy ?

runaOS is a modified operating system based on Windows 11 which removes the negative stigma about Windows 11 such as bloated, unimportant features, and others. runaOS aims to make the system debloated and eliminate things that users do not need along with user needs where bloatware and some features that we do not use can consume the resources we have without our will. Here according to our goals, we are transparent and what we are doing is open source. And this project also supports giving to anyone to contribute and can be a good choice for old computer users who are still worthy of running Windows 10 and want to use Windows 11. runaOS supports for computer users low specifications or powerful specifications.
